# Customer Churn Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to identify key factors that influence customer attrition and to generate actionable business insights for improving retention.

##  Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server
- SQL
- Power BI
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)

##  Project Structure
- `data/` – Raw customer churn dataset (CSV)
- `sql/` – SQL queries used for churn analysis
- `notebooks/` – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python
- `dashboard/` – Power BI dashboard file
- `screenshots/` – Dashboard visuals for quick preview

##  Key Analysis Performed
- Overall customer churn rate
- Churn analysis by contract type
- Customer tenure vs churn behavior
- Impact of monthly charges on churn

##  Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive view of churn patterns, helping identify high-risk customer segments and key churn drivers.

##  Business Insights
- Month-to-month contract customers have the highest churn
- Customers with low tenure are more likely to churn
- Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn risk

##  Outcome
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow — from SQL querying and Python analysis to business-focused Power BI visualization.
